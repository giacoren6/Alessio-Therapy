            <h1>BeKindBloom about</h1>
            <p>I’m Alessio — a hybrid therapist and founder of BeKindBloom, blending sports
                massage, stretch therapy, mobility coaching, and emotional wellness into one
                fluid, body-led experience.
                My journey started in hospitality, where I learned the art of human connection. I
                loved creating meaningful experiences, but something in me craved deeper healing
                — a way to care for people not just with service, but with presence, touch, and
                movement. That inner pull led me to retrain in massage therapy, dive into mobility
                and stretch therapy, and begin my path in Physiotherapy.
                Over time, I stepped into bodywork and became what I now call a hybrid therapist
                — someone who brings together manual therapy, movement, softness, and
                emotional presence to support people in feeling better, freer, and more connected
                to themselves.
                At BeKindBloom, I bring together everything I’ve learned — from deep tissue to
                assisted stretching, emotional holding to scientific rehab — to offer a space where
                healing feels personal, grounded, and real.</p>

                <p>My approach is rooted in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mobility and flexibility training</strong> to help you move freely and prevent injury.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sports massage therapy</strong> to release muscular tension and aid recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stretch therapy</strong> to open up space in the body and calm the nervous system.</li>
                    <li>A growing foundation in <strong>physiotherapy</strong>, which guides my understanding of
                        rehab and body mechanics</li>
                    <li>And above all, a deep belief in <strong>emotional wellness through body
                        awareness and gentle care</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>I work with creatives, athletes, new mothers, busy professionals, and anyone who
                    feels disconnected from their body and wants to come home to it again.
                    Whether you’re here for recovery, relaxation, or reconnection — welcome.This is a
                    space to soften, stretch, and bloom.</h3>
