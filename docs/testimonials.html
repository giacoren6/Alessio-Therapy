            <h3>Emma R.</h3>
            <p>"I’ve had massages before, but this felt completely different. It wasn’t just
                physical — it was emotional release. I left feeling lighter, calmer, and more
                connected to myself."</p>

            <p>"As someone who holds a lot of stress in my body, Alessio helped me access
                parts of myself I didn’t even know needed care. The stretch therapy alone
                changed how I walk and breathe."</p>
