        <article>
            <h2>What is Hybrid Therapy?</h2>
            <p>Hybrid Therapy is a unique blend of techniques that combines<strong>deep tissue
                massage, sports massage, assisted stretching,</strong> and<strong>mobility-focused
                bodywork.</strong>Not just about relieving pain it's about helping your body move
                better, feel lighter, and reconnect emotionally and physically.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Do I need to be flexible or athletic to book a session?</h2>
            <p>Not at all! BeKindBloom is for<strong>every body,</strong>whether you’re an athlete, a creative, or
                someone who sits at a desk all day. Each session is tailored to your level of
                movement, comfort, and goals.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>What should I wear?</h2>
            <p>Wear something comfortable you can move in, like gym or yoga clothes. For some
                treatments (like massage), you'll be covered with a towel or blanket. For mobility or
                stretch-based sessions, you’ll stay dressed and move gently throughout.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Can I combine massage and stretch therapy in one session?</h2>
            <p>Yes, that’s exactly what Hybrid Therapy is for. I’ll intuitively combine methods based
                on how your body feels on the day. You don’t need to choose in advance unless you
                have a preference.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>I’ve never had a treatment before — is it painful?</h2>
            <p>No. My work is<strong>deep, but never forceful.</strong>You’re always in control, and we work
                together to find the right balance between effective release and gentle care.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Do you work with injuries or medical conditions?</h2>
            <p>If you’re recovering from an injury, please let me know before booking. I’m currently
                studying physiotherapy and use safe, informed techniques, but I may refer you to a
                specialist if needed.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>How do I book a session?</h2>

                Instagram @BeKindBloom for last-minute availability or questions.</p>

                UK,</strong>offering treatments in carefully selected wellness locations that align with our
