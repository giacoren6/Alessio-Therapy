    <h3>Hybrid Therapy</h3>

    <p>Every massage & movement is tailored to your needs: firm or gentle, focused or
        flowing, physical or emotional.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Tissue</strong> -for chronic tension relief
                Targets deeper layers of muscle to release chronic tension, knots, and tightness.
                Ideal if you’re feeling physically or emotionally “stuck” and need a strong yet mindful reset.</li>

            <li><strong>Sports massage</strong> – for recovery & performance, Focused on muscle recovery and performance support. Helps reduce soreness,
                prevent injury, and prepare the body for movement — whether you are training or just
                always on the go.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Stretch Therapy</strong>– for posture & flexibility, Assisted stretching techniques that open up space in the body, improve flexibility,
                and bring awareness to posture and alignment. Perfect for relieving stiffness from
                long days or inactive routines.</li>

            <li><strong>Mobility Work</strong>– for fluid, pain-free movement, Gentle joint and soft tissue techniques to restore natural, fluid movement. Great for
                increasing range of motion, reducing pain, and reconnecting with how your body
                wants to move.</li>
